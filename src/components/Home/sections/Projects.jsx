          <p>For my final project, my group built a 3-Axis smartphone camera stabilizer using Lego and programmed using C.</p>
          <p>
            A software PID controller we wrote in C was tuned using an equation for angular velocity in terms of the input value
            supplied to the Lego Mindstorms API. To find this function, a slow-motion video was taken of the motor spinning at several
            discrete input values and then analyzed frame-by-frame to find RPM and plotted to find an equation for velocity as a
            function of input-value.
